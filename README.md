bitTorrent clone - allows users to utilize peer-to-peer connections to download pieces of a file!

## Built With
* Python
* Twisted

## Features
* Downloading torrent files
* Allows for quick, concurrent peer-to-peer TCP connections

* Let users also share data (I.E be a peer rather than a leech)
* Implementing a more efficient piece-choosing algorithm (rarest first?)
